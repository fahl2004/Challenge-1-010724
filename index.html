            <p>Elliot Alderson is a young computer programmer living in New York, who works as a cybersecurity engineer for Allsafe Security. He constantly struggles with depression, and his thought process seems heavily influenced by paranoia. He hacks into people's accounts, which often leads him to act as a cyber-vigilante.

              A mysterious man, nicknamed The Professor, plans the most audacious heist ever attempted. To carry out his plan, he recruits eight of the best criminals in Spain who have nothing to lose.

              The goal is to infiltrate the Royal Mint of Spain to print €2.4 billion in 50 € bills in less than eleven days, without any casualties - despite the presence of 67 hostages, including the daughter of the UK Ambassador, Alison Parker, and without any romantic relationships between the robbers... The Professor also instructs the gang members to choose a pseudonym based on city names: Tokyo, Rio, Berlin, Denver, Nairobi, Oslo, Helsinki, and Moscow.
